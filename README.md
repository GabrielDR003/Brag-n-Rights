## Project Ideas

1. **Exercise Webapp:**
    This website would enable users to search for exercises in a database/api. 
    The user could input a set of muscles they want to target in a workout and then the website would recommend a set of workouts 
    based on experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced). If a user just wanted to browse through the workouts available 
    on the api they could do that too. Could also have the webapp double as a fitness/workout tracker. 
    Possibly add a map to show gyms near a users location (presumably google maps api).

2. **Streaming Service Companion:**
    This website would allow users to compare prices and media availability between different streaming platforms. 
    For example, a user could search up a movie and check to see which streaming services allow you to watch that movie. 
    Another component of the website might be to create a watchlist of shows/movies for a given platform and see how much time 
    it would take to view everything. Search by Actors name - > List all the shows/movies theyre in -> 
    Where to watch + how much it costs to rent/buy.

3. **Music Streaming Stats:**
    A web app that allows users to log-in to their music streaming service, like Spotify or Apple Music, 
    and retrieve their statistics. These stats would be things like their most listened songs, artists, and genres. 
    This site would take that data and display it using charts, graphs, tables, etc. Additionally, users would be given a few 
    recommendations based on their listening history/patterns. The app would also take the users data and allow them to unlock 
    various “achievements”. For example, they could get an achievement for listening to 20 different genres/subgenres.
