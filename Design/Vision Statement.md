# Vision Statement
We are creating a fitness based web application. This application aims to allow users to create 
the ideal exercise routine for themselves, based on the muscles they want to target. The user 
would also be able to select where they are at in their fitness journey as well as see where
they can find their local gyms. Additionally, users could use this app to view the nutritional 
information and macros of common foods. Furthermore, they could view AI generated recipes based 
on the foods they want to include. The reason we are creating this app is to offer a free, 
all-in-one fitness app that will help users achieve their fitness goals. While other apps 
exist that serve a similar purpose, our app would remain free, and it would keep everything 
contained in one convenient location.
